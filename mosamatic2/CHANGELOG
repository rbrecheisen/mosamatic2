- Added option to generate probabilities in SegmentMuscleFatL3TensorFlowTask

2.0.25
======
- Updated CalculateScoresTask to allow:
    (1) Specification of patient heights and genders file in CSV format
    (2) Calculation of BMI
    (3) Calculation of sarcopenia
    (4) Calculation of sarcopenic obesity
    (5) Calculation of myosteatosis
    (6) Calculation of visceral obesity

======
- Added ApplyThresholdToSegmentationsTask for adjusting segmentation masks based
  on image HU thresholds. This is particularly useful to remove edema from muscle
  segmentations.

  threshold for myosteatosis map, as well as alpha
- Updated DefaultPipeline to also set low/high HU threshold and alpha for the 
  myosteatosis maps

2.0.23
======
- Implemented Numpy to NIFTI and NIFTI to Numpy conversion task so the segmentation
  output can be edited outside Mosamatic, e.g., using ITK-SNAP
  
2.0.22
======
- Implemented SliceSelectionViewer with sagittal view check and copy

======
- DefaultDockerPipeline has Docker image version field (default: 2.0.10)

2.0.17
======
- Added LiverAnalysisPipeline

2.0.16
======
